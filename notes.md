Committed Beer Component: 5:24 A.M.
  I played around a lot with the console after struggling with defining 'this' inside my class component.
  When I figured out why it wasn't working I fixed the issue and started to play around with what data from
  the beer array I should display and how it would be styled. I actually learned a lot and a few concepts clicked
  after digging through the React console. Although it took me a couple of hours to complete the component, I learned
  where to look if things aren't working correctly and how to fix those issues. I feel a lot more confident in my understanding
  of React components and their lifecycle methods.
